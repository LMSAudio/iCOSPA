# iCOSPA
The repository provides audio examples for the soon-to-be-published paper "Exploiting spatial information with the informed complex-valued spatial autoencoder for target speaker extraction" (accepted at ICASSP 2023).

## Audio Examples
We provide audio examples for the propsed iCOSPA trained for four different target signals (MVDR, DSB, signal image at first microphone, dry) and the original COSPA (https://github.com/ModarHalimeh/COSPA) for the task of target speaker extraction from a mixture of speakers from four exemplary directions of arrival (DoAs) of the target speaker.

DoA | mixture (1st mic) | target signal (MVDR) | COSPA-mvdr | iCOSPA-mvdr | iCOSPA-dsb | iCOSPA-mic1 | iCOSPA-dry|
